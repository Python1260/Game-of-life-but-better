# THIS IS CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE BUT BETTER(BY ME)
In this game, that is a more watching than interactive game, many colors fight for the win (taking over the map) while trying not to get sick and not to erase their existence from the game window.

# RULEZ
It's simple: if a cell has less than one neighbor or more than three neighbors, it turns black and does nothing. If a cell is black/deactivated and it has more than three neighbors, it comes back to life. If a cell has more neighbors in any other color than itself, it turns in this color.

# CONTROLS
SPACE = play/pause the game
RIGHT ARROW = evolve each cell -> process to the next generation (pause only)

LEFT MOUSE CLICK = paint with cells (pause only)
RIGHT MOUSE CLICK = choose the cell painting color by pressing on a cell (pause only)
MOUSE SCROLL = change the delay between automatic generations (play only)


# Tell me what you think!
